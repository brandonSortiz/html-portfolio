  <h1>Top Movies of All Time According To Brandon</h1>
  <h2>My Best 3 Movies.</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
  <p>The story telling in this movie was able to engage not only children but adults too.</p>
  <h3>Get Out</h3>
  <p>This film captured disturbing/uncomfortable emotion and tied humor towards the end tieing everything together.</p>
  <h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
  <p>This is yet another animated film that at first not appear to have much dialogue. However you are distracted by how cinematic the scenes are. </p>
