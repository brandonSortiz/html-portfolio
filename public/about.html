  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Being a first generation from immigrant parents I was led to believe going to college, getting a degree and 
    office job was the only future for myself. Afraid of disappointing my parents I attempted to go to community
    college in hopes of finding a career I wanted to pursue and eventually transfering to a University to get 
    a bachelor's degree. Frustrated with what I wanted to do for my life long career, I was uncertain on what
    to pick for longer than most people my age. Becoming a dental hygienist seemed like a fit for me but 
    when I took my first organic/inorganic chemistry class I knew the career I wanted to pursue was not
    going to go smoothly.

  <p>Fast forward two years I stopped joing to community college and started working in the mean time.
    I recently moved out of my parents house and wanted to learn how to make enough money where I did not have to worry 
    about bills. This is when I finally decided to try how to learn to code! Like most people who have an ambition of 
    wanting to become successful, I did not know where to start. Friends and family would tell me that I would need to 
    go to school and get a degree to become successful in today's society. I refused to believe a degree would determine
    whether or not I become successful.

    Nevertheless, I wanted to choose a language that seemed simple enough for me to
    my coding career. That language was HTML and soon after CSS. While learning one language at a time is what most 
    people advise, HTML and CSS is an exception because they work hand to hand in creating something great! Javascript
    on the other hand was a whole new ballpark. Even though Javascript is a key language in front end devleopment, it
    is without a doubt a language that needs to be studied and practiced after learning HTML and CSS. Learning HTML,
    CSS and Javascript would be too overwhelming ultimately leading the individual to stop pursuing how to code.

    I am slowly learning the ropes in front end web development in hopes of becoming a full stack developer so
    I can financially support myself and enjoy my 20s!
